I'm a machine learning engineer.

I shipped many safety critical features at Tesla Autopilot, working on FSD.

I spent some time at Twitter, helping with the acquisition.

I am now the Founding Research Scientist at Harvey AI, building the future of knowledge work.

I enjoy rock climbing and drone cinematography.

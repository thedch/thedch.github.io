# Welcome!

This is my website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build), using the [Astro Micro](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro) theme.

I host it on GitHub pages, you can [see it here](https://thedch.github.io).

I use this as a place to share my thoughts, projects, and other things I'm interested in.

## Development

To start the dev server, run:

```
make dev
```

Before pushing to GitHub, run:

```
make build
```
